# A decentralized on-chain open-outcry auction system based on blockchains

A graduation project from the Computer and Systems Engineering Department at Alexandria University, implementing an open auction system using the Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) blockchain platform.

## Abstract

Blockchain technology has revolutionized online applications by introducing decentralization, transparency, and immutability. Auctions, widely adopted across industries, benefit from these properties to ensure fairness and trust. This project explores a blockchain-based open-outcry auction system, addressing challenges such as limited accessibility, centralized dependencies, and bid timing accuracy. By leveraging smart contracts and distributed mechanisms, the system ensures tamper-proof, transparent, and scalable bidding processes. The design incorporates trusted timestamps and consensus mechanisms to maintain fairness and support global participation.

This work is inspired by the paper "Digitalized and Decentralized Open-Cry Auctioning: Key Properties, Solution Design, and Implementation" (DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3395791).
