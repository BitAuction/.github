## 🧾 Abstract

Blockchain technology has revolutionized online applications by introducing decentralization, transparency, and immutability. Auctions—widely adopted across industries—benefit from these properties to ensure fairness and trust. This project explores a blockchain-based open-outcry auction system, addressing challenges such as limited accessibility, centralized dependencies, and bid timing accuracy.

By leveraging smart contracts and distributed mechanisms, the system ensures tamper-proof, transparent, and scalable bidding processes. The design incorporates trusted timestamps and consensus mechanisms to maintain fairness and support global participation.

This work is inspired by the paper:  
**_"Digitalized and Decentralized Open-Cry Auctioning: Key Properties, Solution Design, and Implementation"_**
